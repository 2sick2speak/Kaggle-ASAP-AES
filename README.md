Text mining tools & solutions
===============

Hierarchy:

* \data\ - folders for input-output data. But don't try to add here big volumes of data - nobody needs it in repo
* \R\ - R code
* \R\data processing\ - methods for extracting data from different sources
* \R\data rearrangement\ - data preprocessing methods (stemming, stop words removal etc)
* \R\feature engineering\ - create features for your solutions(DTM-matrix, popular words counter)
* \R\models\ - similar to features but more complicated models for your tasks (like clustering methods)
* \R\solutions\ - here in different solutions you can compose different methods to achieve results
* \R\visualisations\ - your visualisation methods
* \R\libraries.R - list of libraries required for your solutions
